Repositories for Workflow Templates
===================================

The package contains a default implementation for a repository to maintain workflow templates and extended benchmark templates. The repository stores most of the relevant information in separate directories and files on the file system. In addition, some information is maintained in a relational database.


Directory Structure
===================

The **Template Repository** is used to maintain copies of workflow templates in a uniform way. All templates are maintained as files on the file system under a base directory. The respective directory structure is as follows:

.. line-block::

    <base-directory>/
        repo.db
        <template-id>/
            static/
            repository.json


Each template is assigned a unique identifier. The identifier is used as the directory name for all information related to to template. For each workflow template static files are stored in a sub-directory ``static``. The template specification is maintained (in Json format) in a file called ``template.json``.

When the template is added to the repository, either a source directory on the file system or the URL of a Git repository is expected. If a repository URL is given, the repository will be cloned into a local source directory. The repository will create a new sub-directory for the template using an automatically generated unique identifier. The repository expects a file containing the template specification in the given source. By default, the repository will look for a file with one of the following names (in this order):

.. line-block::

    benchmark.yml
    benchmark.yaml
    benchmark.json
    template.yml
    template.yaml
    template.json
    workflow.yml
    workflow.yaml
    workflow.json

The first matching file is expected to contain the template specification. The suffix determines the expected file format (``.yml`` and ``.yaml`` for files in Yaml format and ``'json`` for Json format). If a specification file is found, the content is stored as ``repository.json`` in the template folder. All files in the source directory are (recursively) copied to the ``static`` folder.


Database
========

The **Template Repository** maintains additional information about templates and benchmark runs in a relational database. The database schema has two tables **benchmark** and **benchmark_runs**:

.. code-block:: sql

    --
    -- Each template has a unique identifier and name, a short descriptor and a
    -- set of instructions.
    --
    CREATE TABLE template(
        id CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        description TEXT,
        instructions TEXT,
        PRIMARY KEY(id),
        UNIQUE(name)
    );

    --
    -- For each benchmark run the run state is maintained as well as timestamps
    -- for different stages of the executed workflow.
    --
    CREATE TABLE benchmark_run(
        id CHAR(32) NOT NULL,
        template CHAR(32) NOT NULL REFERENCES benchmark(id),
        state VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
        created_at CHAR(26) NOT NULL,
        started_at CHAR(26),
        ended_at CHAR(26),
        PRIMARY KEY(run_id)
    );


For each template the unique identifier and name are maintained, together with an optional short description and a list of instructions for participants. The template name is used as the human-readable identifier and is therefore expected to be unique.

Each benchmark runs has a unique identifier and references the respective template. For benchmark runs various timestamps are maintained (all in UTC time). The ``created_at`` timestamp denotes the time when the run was submitted. The ``started_at`` timestamp is the time when the corresponding workflow engine started the execution of the run. The ``ended_at`` timestamp denotes the time when the workflow terminated. Depending on the ``state``, this timestamp may either be the time of successful completion or the occurrence of an error or an event that canceled workflow execution.

By default, SQLite is used as the database management system. The default database file is ``repo.db`` in the base directory of the repository.

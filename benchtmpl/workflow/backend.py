"""Abstract interface for the workflow execution engine. The reproducible
benchmark engine is flexible with respect to the workflow engine that is being
used.

Each engine has to implement the abstract workflow engine class that is defined
in this module. The engine is responsible for interpreting a given workflow
template and a set of template parameter arguments. The engine is also
responsible for retrieving output files and for providing access to these files.
